 * can have either a `matrix` or any combination of
 * `translation`/`rotation`/`scale` (TRS) properties. TRS properties are
 * converted to matrices and postmultiplied in the `T * R * S` order to compose
 * the transformation matrix; first the scale is applied to the vertices, then
 * the rotation, and then the translation. If none are provided, the transform
 * is the identity. When a node is targeted for animation (referenced by an
 * animation.channel.target), only TRS properties may be present; `matrix` will
